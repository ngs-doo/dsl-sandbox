 <p><strong>Entity</strong> is a mutable object with identity. Each entity has one or more key properties and an URI property that represents serialized keys.</p>
<p>Example shows an Engine entity with property 'serialNumber' defined as a primary key. In this case, URI is equal to serialNumber, as it is the only key.</p>
