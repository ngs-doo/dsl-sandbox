 <p><strong>Aggregate root</strong> is a collection of objects that usually corresponds to a single table or document-like structure.</p>
<p>This example shows a DSL which results in two PHP classes: Team and Player. Both have string properties defining their names. Additionally, Player class has a team property stating which team are they playing for.</p>
<p>Each aggregate root has a <strong>primary key</strong>. Primary key is specified in brackets after aggregate root name in model. When primary key is left out, like in this scenario, surrogate ID key is created. To take a look at an alternative way to write this DSL, open the FootballWithKeys.dsl file. There both roots have explicitly defined keys. The sequence keyword defines incrementing value, similar to 'autoincrement' and 'serial' concepts used in other databases. Note that both DSL files are completely identical and will result in identical objects created. Usually, when using ID keys, we leave them out from DSL to simplify the code.</p>
<p>Now, try running PHP (click the 'Run' button). The code will create a player and a team in the database. In the output you can see the ID and name properties defined in DSL. ID property was assigned a value by the server. Additionally, each object has a property named URI, which represents a string serialization of primary keys. In this case, only one primary key is defined, so URI and ID values are identical. Also, the Player object has added teamURI and teamID properties, which are used to reference the Team object.</p>
