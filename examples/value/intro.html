 <p><strong>Value</strong> is an object that contains attributes and has no identity. Values can be regarded as immutable (although they are currently mutable in PHP).</p>
<p>Values represent objects whose identity doesn't matter when comparing two objects for equality. Two or more value objects are considered equal if their property values are equal.</p>
