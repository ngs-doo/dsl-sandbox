# DSL platform sandbox

Learning and showcase/testing environment for DSL platform.

DSL platform sandbox is hosted at [learn.dsl-platform.com](https://learn.dsl-platform.com/).

Sandbox contains a list of interactive examples representing various platform concepts. Each example consists of source DSL, PHP client code, and generated PHP and platform files. PHP code in each example can be sent to server for execution. Resulting output is monitored for basic events (clicking and posting forms) which will also trigger PHP execution. This allows embeding interactive snippets or small apps.
